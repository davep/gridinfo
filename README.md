# gridinfo

**CAUTION:** Work in progress.

A simple terminal-based application, written in Python and with
[Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/), that provides access to headline
information about [Linden Lab's](https://www.lindenlab.com/) virtual world
[Second Life](https://secondlife.com/).

Written as a wrapper around parts of both the Second Life API, and the
[GridSurvey](http://www.gridsurvey.com/)
[API](http://www.gridsurvey.com/api.php) by [Tyche
Shepherd](https://toot.community/@tyche_shepherd).
